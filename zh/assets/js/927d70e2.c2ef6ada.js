Casdoor\'s SSO simplifies the login process by allowing users to authenticate just once to access multiple services. This not only enhances user convenience but also boosts engagement and satisfaction.\\n\\nFor businesses, Casdoor\'s SSO streamlines user credential management, enhancing security and simplifying new user onboarding. It counters the risk associated with weak or recycled passwords by centralizing user management.\\n\\nHowever, in the face of growing online threats, integrating robust security measures in SSO systems like Casdoor is vital. This is where face authentication technology comes into play, adding an extra layer of protection while maintaining user-friendly interactions.\\n\\nFace authentication employs unique facial characteristics to confirm user identities. It compares live images with stored facial templates, offering a secure yet straightforward way to authenticate users. This method boasts high accuracy, even under varied conditions, and is widely adopted in modern consumer devices.\\n\\nIntegrating face authentication into Casdoor\'s SSO system promises a secure, efficient, and seamless user experience. To ensure optimal performance, it is crucial to focus on:\\n\\n1. _Anti-Spoofing Measures_: Implementing liveness detection, like tracking eye movements or random gestures, is essential to counteract spoofing attempts and maintain system integrity.\\n\\n2. _Regular Updates for Improved Accuracy_: Keeping the face authentication technology updated with the latest AI and biometric advancements ensures accuracy and enhances user experience. It\'s vital to use diverse datasets for algorithm training to prevent biases.\\n\\n3. _Balancing Security and Convenience_: The best systems strike a perfect balance between stringent security measures and user convenience. This approach encourages user adoption by ensuring a straightforward authentication process without compromising security.\\n\\nIn conclusion, by integrating face authentication with Casdoor\'s SSO, businesses can offer a secure, efficient, and user-friendly login experience. This not only fortifies security but also aligns with modern user expectations in the digital world."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor-website/edit/master/i18n/zh/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2021-08-24.mdx","source":"@site/i18n/zh/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2021-08-24.mdx","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to Casdoor official website!\ud83d\udc4b","date":"2021-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2021\u5e748\u670824\u65e5","tags":[{"label":"Casdoor","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/casdoor"},{"label":"SSO","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/sso"},{"label":"Authentication","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/authentication"},{"label":"OAuth2.0","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/o-auth-2-0"},{"label":"Casbin","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/casbin"}],"readingTime":0.97,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"ErikQQY","title":"Casbin Member","url":"https://github.com/ErikQQY","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52615090?s=120&v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","author":"ErikQQY","authorTitle":"Casbin Member","authorURL":"https://github.com/ErikQQY","authorImageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52615090?s=120&v=4","tags":["Casdoor","SSO","Authentication","OAuth2.0","Casbin"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Enhancing App Security and User Experience with Casdoor Face Authentication SSO","permalink":"/zh/blog/face-authentication-casdoor-sso"}},"content":"Welcome to Casdoor official website!\ud83d\udc4b\\n\\n## What is Casdoor?\\n\\nCasdoor is a UI-first [Identity Access Management (IAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management) / [Single-Sign-On (SSO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) platform based on OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SAML and CAS.\\n\\nCasdoor is developed by [Casbin](https://casbin.org) using Golang and React.\\n\\nCasdoor aims at providing a powerful authentication platform to handle the user management.\\n\\n## Why use Casdoor?\\n\\n* \u26a1\ufe0f Powerful feature and simple config.
